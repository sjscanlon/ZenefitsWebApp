**Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML-
and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as
optional JavaScript extensions.

**Editable Table
The Notes portion of the app was created using an editable table using javascript to store the notes locally on
browser storage. It allows users to make changes to notes to any length they want. Notes can be added with the
[+] button or removed with the [x] buttons.
